# Just DONE the fxxking work!!!
Always failed to download something due to unstable network connection?

Tired of retrying it mannually?

This script simply try it again and again till it succeeds (return code equals 0).

Usage:
```
$ juststdone.sh [-h|--help]
$ juststdone.sh [-i|--interval=SECS] [--] "COMMANDS"
$ juststdone.sh [-i|--interval SECS] [--] "COMMANDS"
```
